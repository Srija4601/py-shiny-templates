# About 

This repository hosts Shiny for Python template files which can be initiated with `shiny create`.

# Requirments

Each template should be in its own folder. If there is only a classic template the top-level app file should be `app-classic.py`. 
If the template supports both express and classic, they should be called `app-classic.py` and `app-express.py`. 
All other files in the directory should work regardless of which top level app file is chosen.
